# Frontend

This React app provides a small portal for uploading documents to the backend
analyzer. Enter the backend URL, choose a file, optionally supply a prompt and
analysis type, and view the returned analysis. Available analysis types are
fetched from the backend via `/analysis-presets` and offered as suggestions.

Run the app in development mode using Parcel:

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```
